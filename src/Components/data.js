  about_me:
    "Hii! I am Rahul Rana. Welcome to my page first of all.I would love to share my journey and how things are going right now.I currently live in India, a very beautiful country. I have done post graduation from Galgotias University (MCA (Master of Computer Applications)). In Web development for example, I master a wide range of technologies , from HTML , CSS , JavaScript here and there as well as libraries such as bootstrap , tailwind , material UI and much more but mostly React Js , React Native , Next Js with all its power.I'm a proficient front-end developer and a UI designer. In the past, I tried many work methodologies (always in the pursuit of efficiency) but occasionally got caught up in perfectionism, procrastination and over-planning. Currently, and being a passionate standardista, the work gets done in the best and most efficient way possible, always targeting high quality standards. I wrote my first computer program in C in the year 2015 and never looked back. Since then , my relationship with technology and software development has undergone numerous transformations. I started my freelancing journey in 2021 and have delivered several projects with high standards. As an individual, I'm always looking for new challenges and researching for new advanced techniques is a constant. I'm achievement-oriented and like to push the boundaries more and more each time, always trying to stay at the fore front of cutting edge technology.",

This is my 2nd project with him and I will hire him many more times.",
